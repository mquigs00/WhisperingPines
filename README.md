Back when I graduated in 2023, I decided to create a web application to learn about full-stack development and implement what I had learned in Database Design. I had never written in JavaScript, and wasn't familiar with node.js and React. I knew basic SQL commands and had run them in MS SQL Server, but had never fully designed and created a database. I started watching Code with Mash tutorials and any YouTube videos I could find on how to build a web application and learned as I went. Between job searching and trying to learn all fo these things at once I eventually got stuck. Now, I have studied AWS and earned my Solutions Architect Associate certification. I can re-use most of the front end code and deploy a SQL Server database on RDS. I will load the data into RDS from S3 .csv files. Then I plan on launching my app on EC2 instances with a load balancer. I am still currently finishing the database schema and gathering book data.

Update 7.11.25:
I've created and loaded my Books, BookEditions, BookCopies, Publisher, Authors, and Subjects tables.
I've gone back to an RDS MySQL database instead of SQL Server just because the licensing costs are not worth it for a self-funded practice project.
I've got my basic front end setup and am starting to combine my Express backend for routing.
